🚦 Smart Transportation System (IoT)
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Smart Transportation System using IoT to monitor and manage traffic efficiently. It uses sensors and microcontrollers to collect real-time data, helping reduce traffic congestion, improve road safety, and support smart city development.

🎯 Objectives

Monitor traffic conditions using IoT devices

Reduce congestion through real-time data analysis

Improve road safety and transportation efficiency

Demonstrate IoT-based smart city solutions

🧠 Project Phases

The project is divided into multiple phases for better understanding and implementation:

Phase 1 – Problem definition & system overview

Phase 2 – Architecture design & component selection

Phase 3 – Hardware & software implementation
